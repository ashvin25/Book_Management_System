Books Management System – MERN Stack

### Overview
The Books Management System is a MERN (Mongo极速赛车开奖直播DB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application designed to manage authors and books. The system provides:
- **Admin Panel**: For authenticated administrators to manage authors and books.
- **Public Site**: For general users to view a catalog of books.
- **Authentication**: Secured admin access using JWT.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.

### System Requirements
1. **Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)**
   - **Authentication**
     - Implement Admin authentication with email and password.
     - Use JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management.
     - Protect all CRUD APIs so that only authenticated admins can access them.
   - **Data Models**
     - Author
     - Book
   - **Features**
     - CRUD APIs for Authors and Books.
     - Support for image upload (book cover).
     - Pagination and filtering support for listing Authors and Books.

2. **Frontend (React.js)**
   - **Admin Panel**
     - Login Form with email and password.
极速赛车开奖直播     - CRUD Interface for managing Authors and Books.
     - List view of Authors and Books with:
       - Pagination.
       - Filtering by name.
   - **Public Site**
     - Display all books in a clean list/grid layout.
     - Each book entry should show:
       - Title.
       - Author's name.
       - Published Year.

### Technical Implementation
- **Backend**:
  - Utilized Express.js for building RESTful APIs.
  - Implemented JWT for secure authentication and session management.
  - Used MongoDB for data storage, with Mongoose for object modeling.
  - Created models for Authors and Books, including necessary fields and relationships.

- **Frontend**:
  - Developed using React.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - **Redux Implementation**: Used Redux Toolkit for state management, particularly for handling authentication and data fetching. Created slices for auth, authors, and books to manage application state efficiently.
  - **Material-UI (MUI) Integration**: Utilized MUI components for a modern and consistent UI design, including:
    - Form controls and inputs
    - Buttons and icons
    - Cards and layouts
    - Navigation components
  - Created components for the Admin Panel and Public Site, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  - Integrated Font Awesome for additional icons, enhancing the UI.

### Additional Features
- Implemented password visibility toggle in the login form using icons.
- Added success and error messages for user feedback during login attempts.
- Ensured proper validation and error handling for user inputs.
- Used Redux for centralized state management across the application.
- Leveraged MUI for a professional and responsive design system.

### Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Multer (for file uploads)
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI (MUI), React Router, Axios, Font Awesome
- **Development Tools**: NPM, Git, VS Code

### Conclusion
The project meets the expectations outlined in the requirements. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing books and authors, with a focus on user experience and security. The additional features implemented, including Redux for state management and Material-UI for design, enhance the functionality and usability of the application, making it a robust system for book management.
